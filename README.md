# Probability Theory and Statistics Course - Analysis of COVID-19 data
This assignment was part of the course Probability Theory and Statistics (Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 4th semester).

The purpose of this work was to analyze data on COVID-19 for various European countries. The data refer to the daily cases and deaths, as recorded on the website [www.worldometers.info](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). For the analysis of the data, statistical parameters, such as mean value, median, variance, standard deviation, interquartile range, etc., were calculated and the appropriate diagrams, such as histograms and boxplots, were created. Parametric confidence intervals for the statistical parameters and the Pearson correlation coefficient were also calculated and a linear regression model was implemented, while the effectiveness of a polynomial model was tested.
